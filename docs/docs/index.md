`protoc-gen-gorm` is a plugin for [`protoc`](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/), the [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) ("proto") Compiler.

The plugin generates [GORM v2](https://gorm.io/) models and supporting code from [annotations](annotations.md) in your proto files.
